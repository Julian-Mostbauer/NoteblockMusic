# Noteblock Music

Made to play music in Minecraft using noteblocks. This is a work in progress.

## How to use

This program generates a minecraft datapack with the song you submitted build in.
Submitted songs must be in the form of a .mid or .midi file.

## Goals

I am currently working on two modes for the music player.

1. Play the song using the playsound command.
2. Play the song using noteblocks.
